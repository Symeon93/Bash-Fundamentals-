   Anchors (search for patterns in the begining or end of the line)
	Here we use a starting anchor denoted as '^'
	and an end anchor denoted as '$'
	e.g. 
	"^A" will search for lines that start with "A"
	"A$" will search for lines that end with "A"
	(these conventions are also used in the vi editor to move 
	 the cursor between the start and the end of the line)
	
	An interesting application is when you search in your inbox 
	to search all of your incoming messages, a way to output the 
	result is the following
	e.g.
	grep "^From: " /usr/spool/mail/$USER(this searches for every line 	
				      	     that starts with "From: "  
   Metacharacters 
	The character "." matches any character, except the end of
	the line character. 
   
   Specifying a range of characters
	e.g. 
	^[0-9]$ (this will find lines tha contain exactly one number)
	"^S[a-z][aueio] " (this will search for a three char word that 			   start with S have a second char a lowercase 
			   and as a third char a vowel)
	
  Exceptions in a character set 
	e.g. 
	[^0-9]  (any char except 0-9)
	[^-0-9] (any char except '-' and 0-9)
	[[0-9]  (any char 0-9 and char '[')
	[0-9-z] (any char between 0-9 and between 9-z)
  
  Matching a specific number of sets 
	e.g.
	^[a-z]\{4,8\} (match any line that start with any lowercase 
		       of lenght 4,5,6,7 or 8 chars)
	
  Matching words with \< and \> 
	Trying to search for a "the" at the begining or the end of the line
	is not that much trivial (punction marks after the "e")
	e.g.
	"\<[tT]he\>" (char before t must be either a new line char or any-
	thing else except a letter, number or underscore; same for the 
	char after the letter 'e'.
 
  Backreferences 
  	e.g. 
	"\([a-z]\)\1" (searches for two identical letters in a line)
	"\([0-2]\)\([0-1]\)\2\1" (searches for sequences that are adjoining
				  in this case numbers like 0110, 2002, 2112
				  1111, 1001 etc)
		
  Extended expressions 
  	To enable extended expressions we use egrep instead of grep
	Here patterns like \{ , \} or \< \> or \( \) are no longer
	usable. 

  	However, we have the usage of:

	"? " (finding 0 or 1 instances of the pattern set before)
	"+" (finding one or more instances of the pattern set before)

	Alternating matching
	e.g. 
	egrep "^(From|Subject): " (This searches the occurence of both 				        	   "From: " or "Subject: " in the begining 					   of a line)

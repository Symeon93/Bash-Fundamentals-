# Bash-Fundamentals-

The material included in txt files is the material/notes 
I took upon self-learning the fundamentals in the 
Linux Command Line and Bash scripting. The material
is a result of the book of Jeroen Jansenns "Data Science 
on the Command Line", courses taken on Datacamp and Dataquest 
as well as of my own experimentation while learning Bash. 


Next building block is investing on the fundamentals to 
implement sed, awk and csvkit for advanced text processing 
and Excel automation.
